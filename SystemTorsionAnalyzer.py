#The code takes a matrix representing relationships (e.g., ethical principles, dependencies in a system) and calculates its Smith Normal Form.  The non-zero diagonal elements (invariant factors) of the SNF are then factorized.  This process is presented as an analogy: the invariant factors and their prime factorizations represent "torsion subgroups," interpreted as cyclical or inconsistent patterns within the system.  The code identifies, but does not resolve, these metaphorical "ethical" or "systemic" inconsistencies.
