# Code Miscellania

A collection of experimental projects, simulations, and personal studies across various domains.

## Projects Overview

### C++ Projects
- **Tavern Simulator** - Interactive text-based simulation of a tavern environment with customers of varying moods and wants. Implement basic AI behaviors and user interaction.

### Data & Machine Learning
- **LAR Algorithm** - Implementation of the Least Angle Regression algorithm for statistical modeling.
- **GPT-Index Integration** - Draft implementation using LlamaIndex (formerly GPT-Index) for creative writing tasks.

### Simulations & Physics
- **KdV Simulation** - Numerical solver for the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation, visualizing wave solutions.
- **Self-Evolving Universe GAN** - Experimental GAN architecture that simulates universe evolution with self-referential data.
- **Theseus Protocol** - Philosophical experiment exploring identity through gradual replacement of system components, inspired by the Ship of Theseus paradox.

### Tools & Utilities
- **Dice Simulator** - Simple dice rolling simulator with configurable dice number and sides (written in Portuguese).
- **Story Generator** - Script using OpenAI's API to generate stories from user prompts with scene and arc generation.

### Mathematical Explorations
- **System Torsion Analyzer** - Calculates Smith Normal Form of matrices to identify "torsion subgroups" as an analogy for systemic inconsistencies.

## Running the Projects

Most projects are self-contained scripts. See individual file headers for specific requirements and usage instructions.

## Note on Experimental Nature

These projects represent various experiments and studies across different domains. Some may be incomplete or conceptual in nature.
